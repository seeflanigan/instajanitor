Breakable toy project, focused on cleaning up an Instagram feed

# InstaJanitor
#
# Purpose: To use Instagram as a more effective tool for growth, and increase the
# potential value of connections on the network, by following accounts where you
# have a higher chance of forming actual organic connections.
#
# For example, if I have fewer than 1000 followers, the likelihood of engaging
# a large influencer with over 100K followers is far less than my potential
# ability to actually engage with a much smaller scale influencer, who has
# between 1000-10000 followers.
#
# This tool identifies large accounts (over a certain threshold) who you are
# following, but who do not follow you back. Then, it gives you the option
# to unfollow them manually, or programatically (within the bounds of Instagram's
# API rate limits), and clean up your followers to identify and narrow them down
# to accounts having a higher likelihood of providing you with value through
# organic interaction.
#
# Note: follower ratio is pretty much a vanity metric, and doesn't appear to have
# significant impact on the actual reach of your content, or organic growth of
# your profile. That said, it exists mostly as a "breakable toy" project, and
# an opportunity to practice coding and problem solving, in a relatively low
# stakes (inconsequential?) way.
#
# The libraries and backend are written (presently) in Ruby, tested with RSpec.
# If a frontend ever exists, it will most likely be created using React.
#
# also with the current state of Instagram APIs, I'm not entirely certain
# whether this even is possible. but trying anyway, for fun.
